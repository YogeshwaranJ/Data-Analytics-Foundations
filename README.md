# Welcome to the Data Analysis Foundations Course!

This repository contains all the lecture materials and code for our introductory course on Data Analysis. This course is designed to take you from the absolute basics of data to performing your first analysis and querying databases like a professional.

## About This Course

Our learning philosophy is practical and hands-on. We use Jupyter Notebooks for all our lectures, allowing you to run the code and experiment with the concepts live. This course is perfect for:

* Complete beginners with no background in data or coding.

* Students with some data knowledge but looking for practical application.

* Anyone who wants to learn the fundamentals of Python, Pandas, and SQL for a career in data.

## Why GitHub?

As a data analyst or data scientist, GitHub is your most important tool outside of your analysis software. We use it for:

1. **Version Control:** To save our work and track every change we make.

2. **Collaboration:** To share code and work on projects with others.

3. **Portfolio:** To showcase your projects (like this course!) to future employers.

Learning to `clone` a repository and manage files here is your first step toward working like a real-world analyst.

## How to Use This Repository

You have two main options to run these lecture notebooks. Google Colab is the easiest and requires no setup!

### Option 1: The Easy Way (Google Colab)

1. Navigate to the lecture file you want to open (e.g., `Intro-to-Data-Analysis.ipynb`).

2. GitHub might show a preview, but to run it, look for the "Open in Colab" badge at the top of the file.

3. (If the badge isn't there) You can copy the URL of the `.ipynb` file from your browser.

4. Go to <https://colab.research.google.com> and select `File` > `Open notebook`.

5. Choose the "GitHub" tab, paste the URL, and click the search button. Your notebook will open right up!

### Option 2: The Local Setup (VS Code or Jupyter)

This is the best way to work long-term.

1. **Clone the Repo:** Click the green `<> Code` button on this page and copy the HTTPS URL.

2. Open your computer's terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to where you want to store the files (e.g., `cd Documents/Projects`).

4. Type `git clone <paste-the-url-here>` and press Enter.

5. All the files will be downloaded to a new folder on your computer.

6. You can then open this folder in **VS Code** (with the Python/Jupyter extension) or by running `jupyter notebook` from your terminal.

## Lecture Series

### Lecture 1: The Journey into Data Analysis

* **File:** `Intro-to-Data-Analysis.ipynb`

* **Topics:**

  * What is Data Analysis and why does it matter?

  * The 6-step Data Analysis Lifecycle.

  * The 4 types of Data Analytics (Descriptive to Prescriptive).

  * **Practical Lab:** Our first analysis! Using Pandas and Seaborn to analyze the Titanic dataset.

### Lecture 2: Python Basics & SQL Deep Dive

* **File:** `Lecture-2-Python-SQL.ipynb`

* **Topics:**

  * A quick refresher on Python fundamentals (variables, lists, dictionaries, functions).

  * A deep dive into **SQL (Structured Query Language)**.

  * Filtering with `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`, `LIKE`.

  * Aggregating data with `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, and `GROUP BY`.

  * The most powerful tool in SQL: `JOIN`s.

  * **Live Practice:** We will use the queries from this notebook on [W3Schools' Live SQL Editor](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all) to see them work in real-time.
